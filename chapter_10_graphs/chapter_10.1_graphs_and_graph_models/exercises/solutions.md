#### Solution

As the edges of the Hawk are with Racoon, Owl and Crow. Therefore it means Hawk competes with them for food. </br>

#### Solution

We can make a directed graph where:-

* Vertices are phone numbers.
* Directed edge between phone numbers depicting a call made from head to tail.

For instance in the month of January </br>
![problem 23](https://github.com/jigjnasu/discrete_mathematics_and_its_applications/blob/master/chapter_10_graphs/chapter_10.1_graphs_and_graph_models/repo/solution_23_jan.png)

For instance in the month of February  </br>
![problem 23](https://github.com/jigjnasu/discrete_mathematics_and_its_applications/blob/master/chapter_10_graphs/chapter_10.1_graphs_and_graph_models/repo/solution_23_feb.png)

By analyzing both the graphs, we can find out the following

* Two new numbers (5555 and 6666) are active in the month of February than January.
* 3333 no longer active in the month of February than January.
* New conversation between 6666 to 2222.
* New conversation between 4444 to 5555.

#### Solution

For electronic mails (emails) we can make directed graph where.

##### solution a)

* Vertices are email address.
* Directed edge between email addresses depicting a mail sent from tail to head.
* Rather than using multiple edges for depicting a several mails from an email to another, we can use numbers over the edge.
* If an email sent from itself, yes loops are allowed.

##### solution b)

![solution 24b](https://github.com/jigjnasu/discrete_mathematics_and_its_applications/blob/master/chapter_10_graphs/chapter_10.1_graphs_and_graph_models/repo/solution_24_b.png)

![problem 25](https://github.com/jigjnasu/discrete_mathematics_and_its_applications/blob/master/chapter_10_graphs/chapter_10.1_graphs_and_graph_models/repo/problem_25.png)

#### Solution

The labels on the vertices can have email address sent and received. In that way if two addresses has the same communication to and from, and the address is different, in that way we can say that address has been changed recently.

![problem 26](https://github.com/jigjnasu/discrete_mathematics_and_its_applications/blob/master/chapter_10_graphs/chapter_10.1_graphs_and_graph_models/repo/problem_26.png)

#### Solution

If in directed graph an edge from head to tail depicts email sent from head to tail. And if there are multiple edges from one vertex to another let's say to hundreds or thousands, we can say a mailing list has been used to deliver the email.

![problem 27](https://github.com/jigjnasu/discrete_mathematics_and_its_applications/blob/master/chapter_10_graphs/chapter_10.1_graphs_and_graph_models/repo/problem_27.png)

#### Solution

* Let's the vertex represents a person.
* Let's a directed edge represents from head to tail that person knows the name of the person.
* Person A can know the name of person B, but it can happen B doesn't know the name of A.
* There is no need of multiple edges, as a person can know the name or not.
* There is no need of loop as everyone knows their name.
