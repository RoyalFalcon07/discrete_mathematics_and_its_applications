![problem 23](https://github.com/jigjnasu/discrete_mathematics_and_its_applications/blob/master/chapter_10_graphs/chapter_10.1_graphs_and_graph_models/repo/problem_23.png)
#### Solution

We can make a directed graph where:-

* Vertices are phone numbers.
* Directed edge between phone numbers depicting number a called number b.

For instance in the month of January </br>
![problem 23](https://github.com/jigjnasu/discrete_mathematics_and_its_applications/blob/master/chapter_10_graphs/chapter_10.1_graphs_and_graph_models/repo/solution_23_jan.png)

For instance in the month of Februry  </br>
![problem 23](https://github.com/jigjnasu/discrete_mathematics_and_its_applications/blob/master/chapter_10_graphs/chapter_10.1_graphs_and_graph_models/repo/solution_23_feb.png)

By analyzing both the graphs, we can find out the following

* Two new numbers (5555 and 6666) are active in the month of Feburary than January.
* 3333 no logner active in the month of Feburary than January.
* New conversation between 6666 to 2222.
* New conversation between 4444 to 5555.
